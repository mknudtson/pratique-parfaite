A vanilla JS game

Please pardon the mess whilst I attempt to work some DOM-manipulating magic to revamp a game which I originally wrote when I had minimal knowledge of coding and didn't how to output anything anywhere other than to the console or in an alert. This iteration is on track to be a lot  more flexible and a lot more fun.
